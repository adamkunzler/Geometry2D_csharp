## Description
Inspired by [OneLoneCoder](https://www.youtube.com/c/javidx9), this project started as a basic 2D Geometry library that provides various functions for the interactions between 2D shapes. After completing the initial 2D Geometry library, I wanted to continue building in other useful mathematical functions and data structures. There are currently libraries for Data Structures, Geometry 2D, Raylib Graphics, and Trigonometry.

## Tech Stack
- C#

## Geometry 2D
See the [function matrix](https://github.com/adamkunzler/KzEngine/blob/main/Kz.Engine/Geometry2d/FunctionMatrix.txt) for an explanation of the different functions and shape interactions.
